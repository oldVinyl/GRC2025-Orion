# MicroPython Requirements for GRC_25 Robot Controller
# This project requires MicroPython firmware installed on Raspberry Pi Pico

# MicroPython Built-in Modules (included in standard MicroPython firmware)
# machine - Hardware access (UART, Pin, PWM)
# time - Time and sleep functions
# math - Mathematical functions (fabs)

# Firmware Requirements:
# - MicroPython v1.19 or later recommended
# - Compatible with Raspberry Pi Pico / RP2040

# No additional Python packages required - all dependencies are built into MicroPython
